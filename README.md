# Portfolio App

This is a CRA TypeScript project. I wanted to see how different a TypeScript project would be compared to a Javascript one.

Plan:
SPA with a few sections:
* Hero - SPA
* About - SPA scroll
* Projects - SPA scroll
* Resume - Separate, plain HTML doc (can probably use github pages one)
* Contact - SPA scroll
